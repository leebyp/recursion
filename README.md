#recursion

In this project, I used recursion to reimplement the getElementsByClassName and stringifyJSON
functions within native Javascript.
A version of parseJSON was implemented using a top down parser method, taking pointers from
Javascript: The Good Parts.

This is a copy of the work I did on a private repo, originally a project from
[Hack Reactor's](http://hackreactor.com) curriculum.
